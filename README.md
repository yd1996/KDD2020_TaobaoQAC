# KDD2020_TaobaoQAC
Due to Alibaba Group's data security policy, we are unable to release the complete version of TaobaoQAC for the time being. But fortunately we have been approved to release a relatively smaller version (still absoluately large) to promote the research of query auto-completion. The released dataset can be downloaded from the following links, and all Chinese characters or words are replaced with digital ids.
